# HACKNROLL2019  
### Inspiration
Inspired by situations where friends and/or family have trouble deciding where to eat together, we decided to build a fun mobile app that does the decision making for them!  
### What it does  
Users simply decide the area that they wish to dine in (For example, Jurong East, Dhoby Ghaut, Tampines, Paya Lebar, Serangoon) and the app’s randomizer will select a food establishment nearby for them to dine in. The user may also filter by the food establishments’ ratings (from 1 to 5 based on Google Maps) as well as the furthest distance from the selected area’s MRT station (from 200m up to 1km). The information comes complete with its address and the option to open in Google Maps to provide clear directions. If the random choice is disliked by most members of the group, there is even an option to reroll it!  
### How we built it  
We used Android Studio and Java to develop the main UI/UX of our android mobile application and Google’s Places API to obtain the relevant data of the food establishments nearest to the selected location.
